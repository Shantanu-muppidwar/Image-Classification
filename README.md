# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

## Overview
This project presents the implementation and analysis of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, a fundamental task in computer vision. The accompanying notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of data preprocessing, model architecture development, training, and evaluation, making it a valuable resource for individuals aiming to deepen their understanding of deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and augmentation strategies to improve model robustness.
- Step-by-step construction and training of a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Rigorous evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and loss, with visualizations to interpret performance.
- Detailed training progress tracking through real-time visualization of results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks utilized for constructing and training neural networks.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries employed for data visualization and performance analysis.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. For the best experience, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cnn-project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNN_Assignment.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Open the `CNN_Assignment.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
- Follow the instructions to:
  - Preprocess the dataset.
  - Construct and train the CNN model.
  - Analyze the model's performance and visualize results.
- Experiment with hyperparameters, data augmentation techniques, or the network architecture to explore different configurations.

## Project Structure
- `CNN_Assignment.ipynb`: The primary notebook containing the complete project workflow.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages for smooth execution.
- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets (users must provide their own datasets in this directory).
